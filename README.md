# Hi, I’m Saish! 👋  
Software developer & applied machine learning practitioner building projects in ML, time-series forecasting, and full-stack dashboards. I enjoy turning research ideas into reproducible code and production-ready demos.

- 🔭 Currently: Preparing portfolio projects for Quant/ML roles and improving explainability (SHAP/LIME) & hyperparameter tuning workflows.  
- 🧪 Past internships: UST, Maybank: hands-on experience in software development and cloud.  
- 🎯 Career focus: Quant Developer → Quant Researcher → AI/ML Engineer → Data Scientist → SDE.  
- 🌍 Based in the UK (open to opportunities).

## What I can help you with
- Building ML/forecasting pipelines and dashboards (Streamlit/Dash).  
- Model interpretability: SHAP/LIME workflows and visualizations.  
- End-to-end project structure for portfolio readiness (data → models → CI/CD → demo).

## How to customize this README (quick checklist)
1. Replace placeholder links (email, LinkedIn, resume).  
2. Update project links to the exact repo URLs and a one-line project tagline.  
3. Swap the GitHub stats theme or add additional badges (shields.io).  
4. Add a short personal photo or GIF (optional) under the top header.  
5. Pin the repos on your GitHub profile for easy visitor navigation.

If you want, I can:
- Fill in the placeholders (email, resume link, LinkedIn).  
- Replace the project placeholders with exact repo names and nice 1-line descriptions.  
- Generate the badges/icons (shields) you prefer and preview the final README.

Tell me what to replace (email / resume / repo links / any wording tweaks) and I’ll return the updated README ready to paste.
